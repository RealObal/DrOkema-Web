# When “Hypertensive Heart Disease” Isn’t the Whole Story: A Missed Apical HCM Diagnosis (and the ECG Clue That Can Save Time)

A long history of hypertension can make clinicians (and patients) assume every cardiac symptom is “just the pressure.” This case shows how that assumption anchoring bias delayed recognition of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (ApHCM) in a 60-year-old African man, until aclassic ECG pattern prompted a deeper look with focused echocardiography.

## Why this case matters
ApHCM is a less common subtype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, reported as roughly 5–10% of HCM cases worldwide, and it’s probably under-recognized in many African settings. In resource-limited environments where cardiac MRI may not be readily available, careful echocardiography (plus a sharp read of the ECG) can still make the diagnosis with high confidence. 

## The patient story (briefly)
A 60-year-old man with about 15 years of hypertension presented with one week of exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and intermittent palpitations without chest pain, syncope, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He had previously been labelled with hypertensive heart disease, but prior echo measurements/images were unavailable, and the old label shaped ongoing treatment decisions. 

His medications at presentation included amlodipine, bisoprolol, losartan, telmisartan–hydrochlorothiazide, and clopidogrel though the reason for clopidogrel was undocumented and there was no history of coronary or cerebrovascular disease.

## The diagnostic clue: deep T-wave inversions without LVH voltage
The ECG showed sinus rhythm with normal intervals, *without* Sokolow–Lyon or Cornell voltage criteria for LVH but with deep symmetric “giant” T-wave inversions (about 7–9 mm) in anterolateral leads (V1–V4, I, aVL). That combination marked T-wave inversion without voltage defined LVH is a recognized clue that should trigger targeted evaluation for ApHCM, even when a patient has longstanding hypertension. 

## Echo + strain: diagnosing ApHCM without MRI
Transthoracic echocardiography revealed apical predominant hypertrophy with maximal apical thickness 18 mm and posterior wall 11 mm, giving an apical-to-posterior wall thickness ratio of 1.6. There was classic systolic apical cavity obliteration with an “ace-of-spades” configuration, preserved ejection fraction (55–60%), and no LV outflow tract obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.

Speckle-tracking strain supported the diagnosis by showing selective apical longitudinal strain reduction (around −12%) with preserved basal strain (around −18%), a pattern that contrasts with the more diffuse strain impairment typically expected in hypertensive heart disease. In this case, a practical echo-based threshold apical-to-posterior wall ratio ≥1.5 plus apical cavity obliteration was emphasized as a workable approach when cardiac MRI is unavailable.

## Fixing the problem: treatment rationalization and outcome
The clinical turning point wasn’t an exotic intervention it was getting the diagnosis right and aligning medications accordingly. Dual renin–angiotensin system blockade was rationalized (telmisartan–HCT stopped while losartan was retained with renal monitoring), clopidogrel was discontinued due to lack of indication, and bisoprolol was optimized as first-line therapy for symptomatic non-obstructive ApHCM.

At two-week follow-up, the patient reported complete resolution of exertional dyspnea and palpitations, with blood pressure controlled (about 132/84 mmHg) and no adverse drug effects reported. Cardiac MRI was recommended for more comprehensive sudden cardiac death risk stratification, but this remained pending.

## Practical takeaways for clinicians (especially in resource-limited settings)
- Deep symmetric T-wave inversions **without** LVH voltage criteria in a patient with hypertension should prompt a deliberate search for ApHCM.  
- A simple apical-to-posterior wall thickness ratio ≥1.5 with systolic apical cavity obliteration can support ApHCM diagnosis even without MRI access.  
- Selective apical strain reduction with preserved basal strain strengthens differentiation from hypertensive heart disease when strain imaging is available.  
- Anchoring bias is real: a longstanding label (like “hypertensive heart disease”) can persist even when new data no longer fit.  
- Medication rationalization can reduce iatrogenic risk (e.g., unnecessary antiplatelets, unhelpful dual RAS blockade) once the diagnosis is corrected.
